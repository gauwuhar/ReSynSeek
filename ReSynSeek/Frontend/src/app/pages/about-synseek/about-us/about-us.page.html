                    Our Story
                </h2>
                <p class="story__description">
                    The idea for the project emerged from the need to address the main challenges faced by modern 
                    scientists: the lack of a centralized platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration, 
                    difficulties in establishing professional contacts with colleagues from different countries, 
                    and the low visibility of scientific works. This project aims to bring researchers together on 
                    a single, intuitive platform, promoting effective interaction, finding co-authors, and increasing 
                    the visibility of their work. By doing so, the project aims to overcome the isolation of scientists, 
                    facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and accelerate scientific progress.
